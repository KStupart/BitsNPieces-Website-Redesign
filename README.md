# Bits 'N Pieces Website Redesign
__Inspiration for Program__

This project was created as a final exam submission for my Desktop Publishing and Design ENG-450 course. I knew that I wanted to create a website from scratch rather than create a brochure. To come up with my topic, I used a random subject generator and got the theme "puppetry." Wanting to use a puppet theater in Florida, [Bits 'N Pieces](https://puppetworld.com/) was the first theater in my Google search results.
